    <title>TSM has shut down.</title>
  </head>
  <body>
<p>I'm sorry but due to certain circumstances with copyright law, TSM has been shut down on 9/22/23.</p>
    <br>
    <p> This domain will still be up, but all the movies and shit will be deleted. I don't want to get in legal trouble more than I already have.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Thank you for a wonderful time.</p>
    <br>
    <p> I'm not sure whether this will be back, but if it does come back, it will most likely be an archive for lost AJR media.</p>
    <br>
    <p> Thank you everyone, and this was a fun project to maintain.</p>
    <br>
    <p>If anyone wants to try and recreate this, they can just message me or something.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Goodbye to TSM, and thanks for all the crazy moments we had.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Best wishes,</p>
    <p>- AJ <3</p>
